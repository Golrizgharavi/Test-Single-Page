                Hello. I’m <b>Dr. Richard Gerhauser.</b>
                I’d like to ask you a question. And I apologize if it’s a bit <b>personal…</b>
                <b><i>How are you sleeping these days?</i></b>
                Meaning, when was the last time you woke up in the morning feeling truly… <b>refreshed?</b>
                Like your batteries were <b>completely recharged?</b>
                And when’s the last time you sat up in bed, bright-eyed and <b> bursting with energy…</b>
                …like waking up on <b>the first day of summer vacation</b> when you were a kid?
                <b> How long since you’ve had that feeling?</b>
                Has it been a while? A decade—or even more?
                Well, despite what you may think… it’s not your fault.
            </span>

            <div class="Title">PLUS: Over the age of 50? Watch below for the scientifically verified solution to your sleep problems…</div>
            <span class="Text">
                AND boundless energy (day after day)…
                In fact, with what I’m about to show you… just days from now…
                <b><i>You could start enjoying a full 84 minutes MORE deep, restful sleep <span class="underline">every night.</span></i></b>
                The fact is: If you’re like most of my patients over the age of 50…
                You’re not getting even <span class="underline">close</span> to the hours of <b>quality sleep</b> you used to.
                You go to bed, but you can’t fall asleep.
                Your mind keeps churning and nagging worries creep in… making it tough to drift off.
                And, when you do fall asleep,<b>you can’t STAY asleep.</b>
                Inevitably, you wake up… <b> wide awake.</b>
                Like your body is saying it’s time to get up.<b>But it’s not…</b>
                It’s still <b>the middle of the night.</b>
                Dawn is hours away… you feel drained, but <b>you can’t fall back asleep…</b>
                Or sometimes it’s your <b>bladder…</b> or frustrating <b>aches</b> and <b>pains…</b>  that wake you up… make you toss and turn…
                And then it’s nearly <b>impossible to get back to sleep…</b>
                Whether it’s one of these problems or <b><i>all of them…</i></b>  the results are the <b>same.</b>
                Every morning you feel drowsy, red-eyed… <b>just plain exhausted.</b>
                Sound all too familiar?
                As a doctor, I can assure you – what you’re experiencing isn’t something “you just have to live with at your age”…
                Because if you watch this presentation and try my method… we’ll finally be able to fix your sleep problems—FOR GOOD.
            </span>

            <div class="Title">
                It all happens by resetting your sleep cycle, then your new, healthy sleep will be on auto-pilot
            </div>
            <span class="Text">
                You see, when you don’t sleep well—even for just one night— <b>your body and brain</b> aren’t able to “recharge”…
                So you <b>barely </b>have the energy to get through your daily routine, much less do the fun, social activities you used to enjoy…
                Sure, you might be able to squeak by that way… but, be honest, does it feel good?
                Or even normal?
                Maybe you’ve even tried sleep aids before – and found they don’t really work?
                I’m not surprised.
                They never actually get to the root of your problems… so they’re a complete waste of money.
                Here’s the truth I’ve been telling my senior patients for more than 20 years now:
                The reason sleep aids don’t work is because…
            </span>

            <div class="Title">
                There are 3 separate issues affecting seniors and making it near impossible for you to get deep “recharging” sleep…
            </div>
            <span class="Text">
                I call them the <b>3 Sleep Stealers.</b>
                Before we get started, let’s identify how many you might have now…
                <span class="underline">Sleep Stealer #1: </span> <b>When you go to bed, does your “racing” mind keep you from falling asleep quickly?</b>
                I know that feeling too, and I’m about to show you a special technique that works like a “light dimmer” to gently calm your brain and help you fall asleep in HALF the time.
                <span class="underline">Sleep Stealer #2: </span> <b>Has your body STOPPED “making sleep”?</b>
                That may sound a little weird, but keep watching and I’ll show you a quick way to check.
                After all, if you often find yourself <b>awake during the night…</b>
                Or <b>wake up far too early</b> in the morning…
                Then your body may have stopped “making sleep.”
                It happens to a lot of people as they get older.
                Luckily, there’s an easy way to fix it. I’ll explain everything in a moment.
                But first…
                <span class="underline">Sleep Stealer #3: </span><b>Do you have any nighttime annoyances,</b>  like getting up to pee or pain that keeps you awake?
                This is the BIGGEST complaint I hear from my patients, but luckily the solution to keeping the pesky wake-up calls at bay is so simple…
                Maybe <b class="underline">all 3</b> of these “Sleep Stealers” sound familiar?
                These issues are the real reason why you have such trouble sleeping…
                And that’s what makes my solution different than anything else you might’ve tried before.
                I’m about to share with you the same thing I tell my patients…
                We can <b>solve your sleep problem together.</b>

            <div class="Title">
                <span class="underline">Right now…</span> for the first time ever,

                And if you follow the few steps I’m about to show you… it’ll be like trading in your current frustrating, unsatisfying sleep…
                For the <b>deep, restful sleep </b>you remember from your teenage years.
                That’s not a promise, it’s a <b>GUARANTEE</b>.

                Fall asleep in <b class="underline">half</b> the time…
                Spend <span class="underline">more hours every night</span> in restful REM or <b>“deep sleep”…</b>
                <b>And dramatically decrease </b>how often you wake up overnight to use the restroom or because of aches and pains…
                In fact, these 3 simple steps are so powerful, they’re…
                …scientifically verified to give <b>an EXTRA <span class="underline">84 minutes of sleep </span></b>every night.
                Let me repeat that… follow these 3 scientifically verified steps…
                And you’ll enjoy almost <b>an hour and a half MORE sleep every single night.</b>

                How to get 10 EXTRA hours of sleep every week thanks to my best sleep secret:
                An <span class="underline">Ancient Roman cherry</span>
            </div>
            <span class="Text">
                It’s shown to give you <b>an extra 84 minutes of deep, restful sleep every night.</b>
                Ever heard of the <b>Roman Dream Cherry?</b>
                Here’s a picture.
                <img src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/health/SOL/dreamcherry_0418/cherries.jpg" class="img-responcive myImg1" />
                They look a lot like the “normal” cherries we’re used to seeing in the supermarket, don’t they?
                Actually, what you’re seeing is a very <b>rare and special kind of cherry.</b>
                It’s an <b>exotic fruit</b> that goes all the way back to ancient Rome.
                And science has FINALLY caught on… the ancient Dream Cherry is a <b>God-send for seniors</b> who have trouble sleeping…
                Just listen to this: Recently, a study was conducted on a small group of<b> seniors with serious sleeping challenges…</b>
                Some of the volunteers drank a cup of <b>Dream Cherry</b> juice every day…
                The rest of the volunteers were given a <b>placebo.</b>
                <b>After just 14 days, </b>all of the volunteers were tested using something called a polysomnographic sleep study.
                (That’s just a fancy sleep monitoring system.)
                That way, they could <b>accurately</b> test if Dream Cherry helped people sleep better.
                And when they got the results, the scientists couldn’t believe their eyes.
